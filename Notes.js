reactJS notes

what's reactJs?

ReactJs it's a javascript library for web client side, in others words
it's a JS library to create user's intarfaces. 

"Mobile apps and desktop apps feel very "reactive": Things happen instantly, you don't wait for new
pages to load or actions to start"

why use React instead Just JS?

Use React instead just JS it's a better way to build apps because using React you don't need to 
be focus in doing every single thing, because React has all of those stuffs in his back, you only
need be focus in how make a smalls react's components and give them a task. however we have anothers reasons
to use React instead Just-js. Wich are the following

* We don't need step-by-step functions. 
* We can created complex UI a better way easier using React instead Just-JS
* Create complex Ui in a Declarative, Component-focused approach
* React can be used to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages

React's component's are a kind of piece of web frontend with body (html) style (Css) and Function (JS) inside them. 
Moreover React's components are a Custom HTML ELEMENT. 


What is a SPAs (Single-Page-Applications)

Its a Web application where you don't need to refresh the page or load a new html
 page because you have all html that you will need already


REACT.Js Alternatives?

ANGULAR:Complete component-based UI framework, packed with freatures. Uses typeScript. Can be overkill for smaller projects.
VUE.JS: It's a kind of mixer between Angular and React
Complete component-based Ui framework, includes most core freatures. A bit less popular than react & angular.


Create a REACT NEW PROJECT?
The traditional approach to create a new React project is using 
npx create-react-app my-app
For this commmand will be executable on your sistem you have to install nodeJs Firts. 


Execute a React's project
Command:
npm start 


Package.json has the all dependencies information. 

it's a good practice put each block of HTML code inside a different file
